# The main purpose of FTG-Station-13
The main purpose of FTG Station is to be a platform for a good closed source builds.
Many people creating a very good projects, based on SS13, but they all will be forced to open their code, because of AGPL. In my opinion, free code is a code that you can use as you like, you can share it with others or keep it closed.
